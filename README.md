# Sane Music Player
A simple music player written in C with Raylib, Taglib, NativeFileDialogs and MiniAudio.

## Usage
Clone the repository and build the project with 'make clean all'. Make sure Raylib and Taglib are installed. If it still doesn't compile, try changing the dependency paths in the Makefile.
Songs can be loaded with Ctrl+O for a single file or Ctrl+Shift+O for loading files from a folder recursively.
Arrow keys can be used to lower or increase volume and to play the next or previous song in the playlist.
